### Extracting the boot image

```bash
# (c)hange (d)irectory
cd ~/Downloads
```

>[!TIP]
>- The `ls` command can (l)i(s)t directories and files that are in your current directory
>- `cd ..` will go to the parent directory

2. Copy the compressed boot file from the firmware folder, containing the files you downloaded with XperiFirm, directly to Downloads folder.
```bash
# (c)o(p)y
# replace <firmware_folder> with the folder of the files you downloaded with XperiFirm
cp "<firmware_folder>/init_boot_X-FLASH-ALL-88DF.sin" .
```

> [!NOTE]
> - A file location with spaces in the name will need to be surrounded by double quotes `""`
> - `.` represents the current directory which should be your Downloads folder
3. Extract the boot image.
```bash
./unsin init_boot_X-FLASH-ALL-88DF.sin
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should now have a new file called `init_boot_X-FLASH-ALL-88DF.img`
### Patching the boot image
1. Connect your phone to your computer with USB cable and enable "File Transfer" in the USB preferences notification.

### Flashing the patched boot image
1. Enter Android Fastboot mode again.
```bash
adb reboot fastboot
```
2. Check that your device is detected by your computer 
```bash
fastboot devices
```
2. Flash the patched image.

```
4. Reboot to the system.
```bash

## Frequently Anticipated Questions
1. Why do I need to use a terminal for everything??
	- Its much simpler to write instruction for terminals that function the same across Linux distributions
2. `some command` doesn't work!
	- You may have mistyped it.
	- You may have forgotten to replace parts of the command.
	- You may need to modify the command to fix the file names that differ slightly.
3. My phone isn't detected by my computer!!
	- Enable file transfers through the notification on your phone.
	- Try a different port/cable.
4. My phone doesn't start any more!!
	- You probably didn't listen flashed the wrong firmware. You need to download the correct one and flash it with [xdaforums.com/t/tool-newflasher-xperia-command-line-flasher.3619426](https://xdaforums.com/t/tool-newflasher-xperia-command-line-flasher.3619426) (will not be covered).
